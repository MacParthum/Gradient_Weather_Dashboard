## Bootstrap Gradient Weather Dashboard
I wanted to refactor one of my class projects and do some cool stuff with it like add font styling and gradient backgrounds. This app uses Open Weather Map Api https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map.  I added a css file and figured out how to rename all the components of the app so I could split them out in the css file and start adding gradients to them and added googlefonts with a gradient to make the text stand out.
